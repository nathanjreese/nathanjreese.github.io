The 2nd half of the season was disappointing, but for an MSR team that was struggling to finish in the top 20 in 2023, 12th in the champioship was a big improvement. Felix hopes to build on the positives from last season as MSR begins a technical alliance with Chip Ganassi Racing, and Marcus Armstrong steps into the 66 as Felix's new teammate.",

He only managed one top 10 in his shortened IndyCar season but did get a class win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At only 20 years old and with a more stable situation coming into 2025, expect Siegel to be much improved this year.",

Daly hopes to prove he's more than just a serviceable fill-in and oval specialist this season. Any win would help him stay in the series but a win at the Indy 500, a short distance from where he grew up, would be life changing.
